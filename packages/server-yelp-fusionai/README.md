- "Tell me about the reviews for Gary Danko restaurant"
- "Are there any free events in New York this weekend?"

## Features

- **AI-Powered Search** - Leverages Yelp's AI API for sophisticated natural language business search
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**:
  - Businesses search and details
  - Reviews and review highlights
  - Events discovery
  - Categories exploration
  - And 15+ other API categories (OAuth, Advertising, etc.)

- **Formatted Responses** - Results are presented in clean, readable Markdown

## Installation

```bash
npm install server-yelp-fusionai
```

## Getting a Yelp API Key

Before setting up the server, you'll need to obtain API credentials from Yelp:

1. **Create a Yelp Developer Account**:
   - Visit the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app) page
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one

2. **Create a New App**:
   - Click on "Create New App" in the API dashboard
   - Fill in the application details (name, industry, contact information)
   - Agree to the Terms of Service and submit

3. **Get Your API Key**:
   - Once your app is created, you'll receive an API Key (Client ID is optional for most operations)
   - Keep this key secure and never expose it in client-side code

## Setting Up with Claude Desktop

   // Start the server on port 3000 (or any port you prefer)
   startServer(3000).then(() => {
     console.log('Yelp Fusion MCP server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File** with your Yelp API credentials:
   ```
   YELP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   YELP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here  # Optional for most operations
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

- **Error: "Yelp API key is not configured"**
  Ensure your `.env` file contains the `YELP_API_KEY` variable and is in the same directory as your server script.

- **Error: "Authentication failed: Invalid API key"**
  Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired. You can check it in the [Yelp Developer Dashboard](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app).

### Connection Issues

- **Claude can't connect to the server**
  Ensure the server is running and the URL in Claude Desktop is correct (`http://localhost:3000/mcp`).

- **Request timed out**
  The Yelp API might be experiencing high traffic. Try again later or check your network connection.

### Toolset Issues

- **Missing functionality**
  If certain tools aren't available, check if you've disabled the corresponding toolset. Use `--enable-dynamic-toolsets` to ensure all toolsets are loaded.
